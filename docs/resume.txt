Biography

I have experience helping to build critical components with development teams that involve authentication and authorization. With a background in cryptography, protocols such as SAML, OpenID, and OAuth are within my expertise. My particular interest is in automating security in software development, including integrating static application security tests into build processes and dynamic application security tests into production environments for monitoring purposes. Additionally, my focus includes cloud security. Based on my background as a trainer, I am equipped with the skills to effectively train and mentor team-mates and colleagues on a wide range of security topics, including secure software development and cloud security.

About me

During my teenage years, I became fascinated with security and hacking, particularly in the realm of social engineering. It all began when I played 'Capture the Flag' with my friends, and I started to learn how to penetrate systems. However, I also learned how to defend against attacks, which was just as important. My passion for security and hacking grew, and I decided to pursue it as a career. To further my knowledge, I traveled to Malaysia to study security and improve my skills. Additionally, I have a strong interest in electronics and microcontrollers. Whenever I have the chance, I enjoy creating projects using Arduino.
