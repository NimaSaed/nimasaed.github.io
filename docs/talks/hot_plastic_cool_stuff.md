## Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM)

- Materials: PLA, PETG, ABS, PC, mixes with carbon fiber and glass fiber.

Pros:

- Low cost
- Easy to use
- Stronger mechanical parts (not PLA)

Cons:

- Lower resolution/detail (not suitable for tiny details)
- Warping/shrinking

## Common issues

- First layer not sticking
- Warping or curling
- Stringing or blobs
- Layer shifts
- Under-extrusion or clogs

::::

:::: column
## Troubleshooting tips

- Wash the bed with dish soap
- For anything else than PLA, you need enclosure to avoid warping
- Keep the filament dry
- Bed leveling and nozzle distance
- Use of slicer preview to catch issues before printing
- Trial and error mindset—it's part of the fun
