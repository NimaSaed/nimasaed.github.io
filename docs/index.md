## Biography

I am a seasoned security expert with 19 years of experience in IT, including 13 years specializing in software and cloud security. My expertise lies in securing critical systems, particularly in authentication, authorization, and cryptography. I excel at automating security processes and integrating them into modern software development lifecycles (SSDLC).

Over my career, I’ve collaborated across industries such as healthcare, education, manufacturing, and technology—addressing their unique privacy, IT, and OT security challenges. My approach centers on making security a seamless enabler for innovation by championing automation and simplicity.

As a trainer and mentor, I am passionate about empowering teams to adopt secure development practices and strengthen their security postures. Whether through penetration testing, threat modeling, or building secure cloud infrastructures, my goal is to ensure businesses thrive in the digital age while staying secure.

## About Me

My journey into cybersecurity started during my teenage years, sparked by a fascination with hacking and defense mechanisms. Friendly "Capture the Flag" competitions with friends fueled my curiosity about how systems operate—and how to secure them. This passion eventually became my career.

To deepen my expertise, I pursued formal education in security technology and cryptography, learning to secure software and build robust systems. Along the way, I’ve developed a knack for tackling complex challenges and finding innovative solutions, both professionally and personally.

In my free time, I’m an enthusiastic maker and tech tinkerer. I enjoy experimenting with electronics and microcontrollers, automating my home, and now, creating with 3D modeling and 3D printing. These hobbies give me a hands-on outlet for creativity and problem-solving, skills I bring to all aspects of my work.
